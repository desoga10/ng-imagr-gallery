+ Fill Available

-- So there are two things you need to know about this:

 -webkit-fill-available;
the -webkit part is an extension for browsers such as safari or chrome, you can find more examples here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions This mean that this code will not work in firefox, to cover every browsers you could use something like that:

elem {
    width: 100%;
    width: -moz-available;          /* WebKit-based browsers will ignore this. */
    width: -webkit-fill-available;  /* Mozilla-based browsers will ignore this. */
    width: fill-available;
}
And the 'fill-available' part means the element will expand to take all available space in it's container. That's why your line stretched.

Hope I could clear it up for you.


auth = inject(authService)

signOut(){
  this.auth.logOut()
}

UUID PACKAGE

Nothing to do with Angular itself, you can get uuid from one of the popular npm package such as this:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid

The code looks like this:

import * as uuid from 'uuid';

const myId = uuid.v4();
However, the uuid package does not define a uuid class (type); it just provides utilities for generating and parsing UUIDs as strings, and for converting between string and byte array representations. So you will not be able to use the type system to ensure that values are valid UUIDs.
