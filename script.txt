+ Fill Available

-- So there are two things you need to know about this:

 -webkit-fill-available;
the -webkit part is an extension for browsers such as safari or chrome, you can find more examples here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions This mean that this code will not work in firefox, to cover every browsers you could use something like that:

elem {
    width: 100%;
    width: -moz-available;          /* WebKit-based browsers will ignore this. */
    width: -webkit-fill-available;  /* Mozilla-based browsers will ignore this. */
    width: fill-available;
}
And the 'fill-available' part means the element will expand to take all available space in it's container. That's why your line stretched.

Hope I could clear it up for you.
